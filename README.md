The first visualization describes the frequency of different bike trip durations. Typically, trips are short (less than 20 minutes), and almost every trip was under an hour.

This visualization is the same as the previous, except further broken down by gender. It is obvious that all genders follow the same basic trip duration trends. Additionally, it can be concluded that the citibikes are far more popular with males than females.

The third visualization is a heatmap that displays the peak times for bike usage. The most popular times to ride, in orange, are around 8am and 5-6pm on the weekdays. It can be concluded that the bikes are used by many people for their commutes.

Also a bike-usage heatmap, this chart is broken down into gender as well, with filtering capabilities in order to select the gender you want to view. Again, all genders seem to follow the general trend of a spike in usage around commute times.

This heatmap visualizes user status as well as gender and looks at what days the bikes are most used within the different groups. As expected, Citibike subscribers ride much more frequently than base-level customers.

This visualization identifies which bikes might be in need of maintenance or repair. Each square represents a bike, and the squares are colored darker for the more trips taken on the bike. There are plenty of bikes with over 300 rides that may require routine maintenance.

This map simply displays the most popular locations for bike rides in NYC. Due to tourists and many commuters, the most rides occur in Manhatten.
